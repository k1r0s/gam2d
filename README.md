## gam2d

trying to provide a lightweight solution for early game developers.

Also separate most of the code in `common` dir which I would like to improve and add more common solutions.

I'm trying to do by myself using html5 Canvas 2d API to build a simple example with:

- A way to handle input events within game context
- An example to move images around (AKA movement)
- An example to implement colliders within objects
- A way to configure how many renders or ticks will be fired for each `requestAnimationFrame`
- Separation of concerns (rendering, ticks)
- OOP features with kaop (inheritance, static classes, even more features are not used on this project)
- More to come... (I hope)

Consider this project as a WIP, coz I'm trying to learn game development (I would like).

Feel free to contribute if you like
